Every year, billions of dollars, hundreds of megatons of carbon and millions of person-hours are wasted because the companies who ship goods and the companies who carry them aren&rsquo;t upfront about their needs and abilities. Our platform finds ways for buyers and sellers to contract binding commitments for plannable and predictable freight and allows those contracts to be traded when needs change. In time, Leaf will become the hub through which the trillion-dollar American freight market is managed.</div><div><br></div><div>We are a team of experienced, smart, and mildly disagreeable troublemakers who like taking on unreasonably big challenges; we know how to build things, we&rsquo;ve lived what&rsquo;s broken in this industry, and we&rsquo;re looking for bright, ambitious people to help us drag the transportation world kicking and screaming into the 21st century.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><span >What does a Frontend Engineer do?</span></div><div><br></div><div>As a Frontend Engineer, you will work closely together with our Innovation, Data and Product teams as well as other Senior FE- and BE-engineers to advance the development of Leaf's internal and customer-facing web applications. You will be responsible for delivering exciting new experiences by rigorously leveraging collected data, e.g. through user analytics. You will transform complex processes into insightful user experiences. </div><div><br></div><div>The role will challenge you to work in a highly agile environment and address strategic and implementational topics.</div><p><b>As a Senior Frontend Engineer, you...</b><ul><li>Partner with our internal Design and Product teams to innovate and develop new design and interaction concepts</li><li>Translate mock-ups and interpret style guides to create cohesive interfaces with modular code</li><li>Develop rich, flexible frontend components to enable engineers to easily and quickly build interfaces</li><li>Share and document knowledge and best practices for frontend development</li><li>Support other team members through code reviews and continuous feedback</li><li>Take initiative to research, troubleshoot and resolve bugs and issues as they arise</li><li>Be a flexible team player, stepping into a variety of roles, as needed</li></ul></p><p><b>Who makes a good Senior Frontend Engineer?</b><ul><li>2+ years of experience building modern web applications</li><li>Excellent knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, React and React Router</li><li>In-depth knowledge of browsers and their behavior</li><li>Passionate about user experience and product delivery</li><li>Experience with test frameworks (e.g. Cypress, Jest)</li><li>Experience with Material UI and React-hook-form</li><li>Good understanding of REST and GraphQL</li><li>Strong communication skills</li><li>Ability to work both self-directed and collaboratively to deliver results in a fast-paced startup environment</li><div><br></div></ul></p><p><div><span >Who doesn't?</span></div><div><br></div><div>What we&rsquo;re trying to do is hard. Technically difficult some of the time, but also hard because we&rsquo;re asking for big changes from people who are usually very comfortable doing things the way they&rsquo;ve always been done. There is a lot of frustration, and it&rsquo;s easy to put a lot of work into something that doesn&rsquo;t bear fruit. But we&rsquo;re here to put a big dent in a gigantic industry, something we&rsquo;ll all be proud of a decade from now.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We&rsquo;re also a startup. Priorities change all the time, something&rsquo;s always on fire, and there&rsquo;s twice as much work to do as hands to do it. It&rsquo;s uncomfortable, new challenges surface constantly, and that means it&rsquo;s up to you to manage how you spend your time in the midst of conflicting priorities. </div><div><br></div><div>We&rsquo;re well-funded, with advisors and investors who&rsquo;ve built legendary companies. But we&rsquo;re also deploying that capital aggressively, so you should expect uncertainty and discomfort.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If the above sounds daunting, you&rsquo;re a perfectly sound and reasonable person who probably won&rsquo;t fit in at Leaf. If this strikes you as an exhilarating milieu, well, let&rsquo;s talk.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><span >Compensation</span></div><div><br></div><div>Cash compensation : $80,000 USD annually.</div><div><br></div><div>The cash compensation above reflects the annual base salary. In addition to base salary, our total cash compensation may include additional compensation for employees in eligible roles. All Leaf employees are also eligible to participate in Leaf&rsquo;s equity plan to receive Incentive Stock Options (ISOs). Individual compensation packages are based on a few different factors unique to each candidate, including their skills, experience, qualifications, and other job-related reasons.</div><div><br></div><div>We know that benefits are also an important piece of your total compensation package. We offer the following benefits:</div><div>&#9679; Equity: Incentive Stock Options</div><div>&#9679; Medical, dental, and vision insurance options at low group rates</div><div>&#9679; 16 company observed US holidays in 2023 plus unlimited PTO</div><div>&#9679; 401K plan</div><div>&#9679; Up to 12 weeks of fully-paid parental leave after 6 months of employment</div><div>&#9679; Stipend toward home office necessities and monthly phone bill or internet</div><div><br></div><div>Leaf Logistics is an equal-opportunity employer and we welcome applicants from all backgrounds. If you&rsquo;re a passionate team player who wants to have an outsized impact on a diverse and dynamic team, we&rsquo;d love to hear from you!</div><div><br></div><div>#LI-Remote</div><p>",

We measure our success in the carbon reduction achievements of our customers. We are looking for team members who love product-building, want to work hard at a mission-oriented startup, and will collaborate with us in shaping the culture of a growing team.</p><p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York and London and remote team members across the US and Europe. We hope that you'll be interested in joining us!</p><b>The role</b></div><p>We are looking for a team member who is excited to do everything involved in shipping great products, including hands-on engineering, talking with customers, mastering the climate domain, and setting direction for the company. You will be joining as an early member of the team that will shape everything that comes next at Watershed. You past experience should include a track record of building things that users love.</p><p>Watershed&rsquo;s technical stack is the web frontend that our customers use, together with a backend of climate data, climate models, and plug-ins to various financial systems. We build new products in a customer-first way so you&rsquo;ll be working quite a bit in React, TypeScript, CSS, etc. There&rsquo;s no need to be a prior expert in our stack &mdash; it&rsquo;s more important that you&rsquo;re good at picking up technologies quickly.</p><p>Some traits that are important to our company culture: Customer-obsessed, hard-working, inclusive, and optimistic. And we&rsquo;re looking for owners, so we hope you&rsquo;ll help us expand this list.</p><p><strong>What you could work on:</strong></p><ul><li>Build new interactive data visualizations to help climate leads understand their company's emissions.</li><li>Build and improve the tools that help companies find reduction opportunities, model future emissions under different scenarios, and track against climate targets.</li><li>Improve end-to-end performance of the app to quickly load a company's entire carbon footprint and make slicing-and-dicing data fast in the browser</li></ul><div ><b>FAQ</b><p><strong>What&rsquo;s your approach to remote work?</strong></p><p>Watershed is hiring team members on all US and EU time zones, and we&rsquo;re committed to growing a long-term distributed team. We have hub offices in San Francisco, New York and London, and remote team members from Oregon to New Jersey to Ireland. There may be certain jobs that need to be in San Francisco / New York / London or certain locations, and will be specifically noted in the job description or in conversations.</p><p><strong>What are Watershed&rsquo;s return-to-office plans?</strong></p><p>We reopened our San Francisco office in June 2021, and treasure the energy and collaboration that comes from working together in person. We&rsquo;re particularly lucky to have a great rooftop outdoor space, where we can gather for lunch, one-on-one&rsquo;s, and the occasional outdoor whiteboarding session. We&rsquo;re also investing deeply to support remote as a first-class hub, with regular Zoom social times, an emphasis on transparency and written artifacts, and periodic offsites to gather everybody in person.</p><p>We&rsquo;re a COVID-cautious company. The office is open to vaccinated team members and we&rsquo;ll continue to pay close attention to case rates to ensure it&rsquo;s safe for everybody.</p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s the interview process like?</strong></p><p>It starts the same for every candidate: getting to know the team members through 1 to 2 conversations about Watershed, your experience, and your interests. Next steps can vary by role, but usual next steps are a skill or experience screen (e.g. a coding interview for an engineer, a portfolio review for a designer, deeper experience call for other roles) which leads to a (usually virtual) onsite interview after that if the screens go well. We prioritize transparency and lack of surprise throughout the process.</p></div>",

The right candidate will be a quick learner with good instincts and have the perfect mix of backend and frontend skills, along with familiarity with modern AB testing, Docker containerized development, analytics, unit and functional testing skills.</span></p><p><span >Our core product is the Slickdeals.net site, but it is supported by many other products that we are actively creating and maintaining. These products are primarily built using open source solutions such as PHP, Symfony, JavaScript and MySQL. Additional languages that you will need to have proficiency with include: Vue, HTML,CSS, Git, and Twig. We are constantly looking for opportunities where new technology can help us improve our product so if you have experience with other technologies, we would love to hear about them.<br/></span></p><p><strong><span >ROLE</span>:</strong></p><ul><li ><span >Work with technical management, engineers, product managers, designers and scrum masters to help Slickdeals achieve business goals by creating software solutions</span></li><li ><span >Develop, test, and debug web applications for the Slickdeals website - both desktop and mobile experiences.</span></li><li ><span >Write unit and functional tests for all new or existing features you work on</span></li><li ><span >Integrate new solutions into our existing platforms.</span></li><li ><span >Optimize and maintain existing applications.</span></li><li ><span >Prepare test plans for features that you develop and work closely with other stakeholders throughout the Quality Assurance and User Acceptance Testing process.</span></li><li ><span >Participate in code review and follow coding standards.</span></li><li ><span >Assist with planning and executing improvements to our application architecture, development environments, and development processes.<br/></span></li></ul><p><strong><span >THE CANDIDATE</span>:</strong></p><ul><li ><span >Strong OOP skills, understanding of design patterns and best practices in modern software development</span></li><li ><span >Hands on technological experience and a strong understanding of PHP, MySQL, HTML and JavaScript.

If you see something that doesn't look right your first thought is to ask, not just accept that it must be fine.</span></li><li ><span >Excellent communication skills. We track everything in JIRA, Confluence, Git commits, and Stash code review comments. We have daily stand-ups, and weekly 1-1s, and semi-annual performance reviews.

Our safe, innovative youth transportation solution is used by over 300 school districts, charter schools, government agencies and busy families to get kids where they need to go.</span></p><p><span >With nearly 500,000 yellow buses on the road every day and 3.5 billion miles driven a year, student transportation is the largest mass transit system in the US. And while districts spend $25 billion annually on transportation, only 30% of kids get to school everyday on a school bus. Add to the equation a crippling bus driver shortage and increasing needs for individualized transportation solutions, and it is clear the current system is expensive, inefficient and ripe for disruption.</span></p><p><span >We create personalized transportation solutions from one to many, and everything in between.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>We&rsquo;re a company with heart<br></strong><strong><br></strong><span >Our partnerships with school districts, child welfare agencies and nonprofits ensure equitable educational access for our most vulnerable populations, including youth in foster care, youth experiencing homelessness, and youth with special needs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span >We understand that the difference between struggle and success can sometimes be as simple as the ability to show up, which is why we&rsquo;re on a mission to use innovative technology, coupled with operational expertise and new thinking to help kids reach their full potential by providing a safe, dependable way to get them where they are going.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>We&rsquo;re an awesome place to work<br></strong><strong><br></strong><span >Our company culture has been well-recognized &mdash; HopSkipDrive has been named to Best Places to Work lists from Built in LA, Comparably, Inc. and the Los Angeles Business Journal. Comparably also named us to the Best Company for Professional Development, Best CEO and Best CEOs for Women lists.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>We&rsquo;re growing rapidly<br></strong><strong><br></strong><span >Founded by three moms as a solution to their own transportation challenges, we now serve nine states and 16 markets across the country and continue to expand at a rapid pace, twice making the Inc. 5000 and Deloitte 500 Fast-Growing Technology lists. Backed by top-tier venture capital firms, HopSkipDrive has raised $70M in funding to date.</span></p></div><p><strong>Who you are</strong></p><p><span >The Senior Rails Engineer should be seen as a rock-solid engineer who is a master of Ruby, Rails, and web development in general. The Senior Engineer is capable of owning technical design for projects of moderate complexity, and understands the tradeoffs in creating good software. They hold a depth of knowledge in systems that enables them to debug those systems effectively without flailing. In addition to writing consistently high-quality code they are aware of industry best practices and trends, and have acquired at least one major specialty such as performance optimization, testing, API design, frontend development, or project management.</span></p><p><span >The Senior Engineer gets a lot done. They are responsible for complex tasks and complete them despite roadblocks, grabbing others for help or insight as necessary. The Senior Engineer requires very little oversight beyond high-level direction; they can take a complex user story, break it down into sub-tasks, and complete their sub-tasks with relative ease. The Senior Engineer shows initiative beyond knocking tasks off a list; they are able to identify and suggest areas of future work for themselves or their teams. They seek evidence to support their ideas and start to build cases for these ideas. They deliver products to QA that they believe are well-baked and bug-free.</span></p><p><span >The Senior Engineer has end-to-end responsibility for projects of increasing complexity that encompass more than their own development. They contribute to the common code bases and standards for the team. They understand the business that their code supports, and possess empathy for the users of their software; they use this understanding to influence their task prioritization. They assist QA in identifying and validating test cases and can identify regression risks in their features. In general, they can identify risks in code, features, and design, and communicate these to the appropriate parties.</span></p><p><span >The Senior Engineer is known outside of their core team as a technology leader. They participate extensively in code reviews, and mentor others via code reviews and pairing. They work effectively with non-tech members of the company. They are able to identify problems with requirements and help their team course-correct around these issues.</span></p><p><span >Above all, they want to build something that fundamentally improves the lives of families.</span></p><p><strong>What we&rsquo;re looking for</strong></p><p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p><ul><li ><span >3+ years experience with Ruby on Rails</span></li><li ><span >5+ years of professional software engineering</span></li><li ><span >Advanced experience with PostgreSQL or MySQL</span></li><li ><span >A thirst for knowledge and continuous learning</span></li><li ><span >Ability to unblock themselves and other team members</span></li><li ><span >Excellent communication skills with technical and non-technical teammates and showed a high level of emotional and professional maturity.</span></li><li ><span >Succeeded as an engineer when presented with projects of increasing complexity over time across multiple areas or domains of the code/product</span></li><li ><span >Earned a high level of trust amongst team to own a task/project without needing much supervision</span></li><li ><span >Demonstrated ability to anticipate how contributions can affect larger architecture, developing risk mitigation and contingency plans</span></li><li ><span >A high level of craftsmanship about your work, the end experience of the user, and impact on overall product</span></li><li ><span >A connection to HopSkipDrive&rsquo;s mission and values</span></li></ul><p><strong>Primary Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li ><span >Communicate well with all members of the team</span></li><li ><span >Perform well-defined engineering tasks; doesn&rsquo;t get caught up in the unknown, works to figure it out, asks questions</span></li><li ><span >Alert manager/team to any issues preventing your work from being accomplished, asks for help</span></li><li ><span >Actively pursue improving engineering skills, including but not limited to problem solving, writing readable/testable/efficient code, mastering technology in our stack, and learning to anticipate scaling issues.</span></li><li ><span >Contribute meaningfully to the definition of user stories</span></li><li ><span >Seek to tie stories back to user value & impact for our drivers and organizers</span></li><li ><span >Deconstruct a problem into an executable action plan for yourself and other engineers - also perform them to high quality</span></li><li ><span >Own and complete full projects beginning with identifying and communicating the problems to be solved, getting and incorporating feedback on proposed architectural solutions, and making a final decision as the owner of a project.</span></li><li ><span >Lean into challenges when they offer the potential to create large impact, and do so with productivity and positivity</span></li><li ><span >Be highly productive - have a reputation for getting things done quickly and efficiently</span></li><li ><span >Make sure your code is readable & easy to maintain</span></li><li ><span >Make sure your code is tested appropriately</span></li><li ><span >Review other engineers&rsquo; code and provide constructive feedback</span></li><li ><span >Monitor changes in production and rollback if necessary</span></li><li ><span >Have production access and use it responsibly</span></li><li ><span >Be able to dive in to any area of the code/product that you are not familiar with and make changes, guide others in how to do this</span></li><li ><span >Show curiosity to not only learn new things but fully understand how they work</span></li><li ><span >Be a mentor for other engineers</span></li><li ><span >Set and maintain high individual and team expectations</span></li><li ><span >Be able to communicate well with all engineers regardless of seniority</span></li><li ><span >Monitor the outcomes of the team&rsquo;s actions to learn from mistakes and replicate successes</span></li><li ><span >Interview prospective candidates and provide thoughtful evaluations and feedback</span></li></ul><p><span >** This role will be fully remote from a state where we do business&nbsp; <strong>AZ, CA, CO, DC, FL, IL, KS, MD, WI, NC, NV, NJ, NY, OR, TX, SC, VA, MI, WA, MO, TN, NM**</strong></span></p><p><strong>What you will get</strong></p><p><span >We want you to be an owner in our company and share in executing our vision, so every full-time employee has equity.&nbsp; In addition, we offer&nbsp; flexible vacation, medical, dental, vision and life insurance, 401(k), FSA, and an opportunity to work for a uniquely positioned, VC-backed company in a hugely attractive space with significant upside potential.

          "body": "Our Creation Engine teams work on some of the core technologies that power our real time, browser-based Figma Design and FigJam products. These teams work mostly (but not exclusively) on client-side code that runs in the browser. Under the hood, Figma shares a lot of similarities to a game engine. We develop this C++/WebAssembly engine to ensure internal and external developers can rapidly build new products and features that are fast and reliable by default. We're always looking for ways to make our platform more extensible, more performant, less resource intensive, and more reliable. We own areas such as our in-memory data model (SceneGraph), renderer, multiplayer client/server protocols, and plugins and REST API. <br>Figma is a highly collaborative organization and most projects are owned by small teams of 2-3 people. You'll form strong relationships with product managers and designers, and can expect to partner regularly with engineers and leaders beyond your immediate team. We strive to foster an inclusive culture that promotes equity and belonging, and use the following values to guide how we work together: <strong>communicate early and often</strong>, <strong>lift your team</strong>, <strong>focus on craftsmanship</strong>, and <strong>prioritize impact</strong>. You can learn more about our engineering values and how we developed them here. <br>This is a full-time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States. <br><b>What you'll do at Figma:</b><br><strong>In 30 days, you will...</strong><br><ul> <li>Be paired with an onboarding buddy on your team who will help you ramp in our codebase and get to know Figma. You'll move from starter tasks meant to familiarize you with our workflows to joining your teammates on larger projects.</li> <li>Get to know your Figmates across the company via team building activities, participating in our Give a Fig philanthropy efforts, joining one of our Employee Resource Groups, creating something amazing during Maker Week , or having hangs over Zoom (or in person once we're back in one of our San Francisco or New York hubs).</li> </ul> <br><strong>In 60 days, you will...</strong><br><ul> <li>Work closely with teammates and partners in Engineering, Product, Design, Marketing, User Research, and Data Science to build new features and achieve roadmap goals. We prioritize collaboration and cross-functional partnerships, so you won't operate in silos.</li> <li>Craft performance objectives with your manager that align to company priorities and career development opportunities.</li> <li>Help grow Figma by interviewing candidates for teams across the Engineering organization.</li> </ul> <br><strong>In 90 days(and beyond), you will...</strong><br><ul> <li>Be a mentor and provide thoughtful feedback to your peers, and benefit from strong personal and professional mentorship opportunity yourself.</li> <li>Contribute to org-wide initiatives like new hire onboarding, developing interview processes, and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion efforts.</li> <li>Continue ramping and learning. The technical challenges you'll tackle on a Creation Engine team are unique, fun, ambitious, and ever-evolving.</li> </ul> <br><b><strong>Some projects you could work on:</strong></b><br><ul> <li> Modularizing our C++/Wasm engine to support new features in Figma Design and FigJam, as well as unlocking the development of future products </li> <li> Extending our multiplayer protocol to enable more advanced editing and collaboration modes across files </li> <li> Creating frameworks to maintain performance and memory standards across our products -we want to keep pushing the limits of what it's possible to create in a browser while maintaining a highly performant UX </li> <li> Improving our file load times by dynamically loading needed content, optimizing our client-server protocols, and exploring ways to allow users to interact with files earlier </li> <li> Optimizing our renderer in order to increase frame rate during periods of heavy interaction with FigJam </li> <li> Providing rich abstractions and APIs between our React/Typescript and C++/Wasm engine. </li> <li> Expanding the way our users can extend the functionality of our products through plugins and widgets, our REST API, as well through new ML-powered extensibility features </li> </ul> <br><b>We'd love to hear from you if you have:</b><br><ul> <li> At least 7+ years of professional experience shipping features or products with specialization in web frontend frameworks and C++/Wasm, and operating in a tech lead capacity </li> <li> Experience working on game engines, client side technologies and platforms, API products, or developer tools </li> <li> Demonstrated fluency with one or more programming languages, including but not limited to: TypeS cript/Javascript, C++, Python, Java, Objective-C, Go, or Rust </li> <li> Proactive communication skills and a desire to work in a collaborative environment </li> <li> An interest in mentorship, learning from others, and digging into new challenges </li> <li> An inclusive approach towards building features, solving problems, investing in culture, and growing teams </li> </ul> <br><b>Our end to end process will cover, at a high level:</b><br><ul> <li>An initial non-technical call with a recruiter.</li> <li>A live practical technical screen with an engineer using the programming language of your choice.</li> <li>A video-based conversation with the manager of your potential team.</li> <li>A fully virtual \"onsite\" interview with both technical/coding and non-technical/discussion-based areas of focus.</li> </ul> <br>At Figma, one of our values is Grow as you go.

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among adults over 65. At the same time, fall prevention and emergency response systems for older adults are archaic and ineffective. This issue is exacerbated by the inefficient procedures that operators of these facilities are forced to use to provide care to their residents.&nbsp; Sage's integrated software aims to reinvent how we care for and respond to older adults in times of need.&nbsp; We aim to build a platform that gives caregivers the means to provide care for modern aging.</p><p>Sage is a small, tight team of ambitious, multi-disciplinary entrepreneurs.&nbsp; We are a software-enabled, mission-driven company, and are focused only on the problems that are central to achieving that mission.&nbsp; At Sage, we work hard and fast but also know that to build a truly important company, we need to treat our work as a marathon, and not a sprint.&nbsp; The journey matters.&nbsp; We know when to slow down, take breaks, and have fun.</p><b>About This Role</b><p>As a frontend engineer, you will be one of the main developers building the UI of the Sage platform, starting with the Sage Caregiver App.&nbsp; You will work directly with Sage's engineering and product leaders to design and implement features that will be used by front-line workers providing critical care, and you will have a direct impact on the direction the UI takes.&nbsp; In this role you will be responsible for ensuring that the features, look, and feel of our application meet the highest design and usability standards and that the application is a joy for our users to interact with.&nbsp; Experience with frontend web development and UI design is helpful, but most important is a strong software development foundation along with an unconstrained drive to learn and grow.</p><p>This role requires close collaboration with a small team of engineers, along with our CPO and other product managers.&nbsp; We believe in our developers building user empathy and having first-hand experience with the environments for which they are building.&nbsp; At times you will have direct exposure to users of the platform and opportunities to visit facilities to see the product in action.</p><p>Some examples of the work you could be doing on any given day include the following:</p><ul><li>Designing and implementing a feature that caregivers at a facility have requested&nbsp;</li><li>Implementing responsive UI layouts for desktop, iPad, and mobile</li><li>Optimizing UI performance by leveraging modern web tools</li><li>Partnering with our design team to think through the feasibility and implementation of a new design</li></ul><b>Requirements</b><p>These traits are essential to success in this role:</p><ul><li>At least 2 years of experience as a developer</li><li>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related field or equivalent industry experience</li><li>Experience with a Javascript UI framework (ex. React, Angular, Vue)</li><li>Familiarity with interacting with REST APIs</li><li>Demonstrated ability to breakdown complex problems and explain them, at the correct level of detail, to both technical and non-technical audiences</li></ul><p>These are not essential, but are a plus:</p><ul><li>Experience with React and Redux</li><li>Experience with MaterialUI</li><li>Experience working with UI designers and product managers</li><li>Experience with Yarn and NPM</li><li>Experience designing REST APIs</li><li>Familiarity with UI design tools such as Figma</li></ul><b>Benefits</b><p>Our headquarters are located in New York City's lively Meatpacking district, and we run the office as you would a family household.&nbsp; While we take our mission seriously, we definitely do not take ourselves too seriously.&nbsp; We have grocery orders for snacks every Monday, drink orders whenever we run low, have team lunches out at local restaurants most days of the week, and get together for \"family dinners\" where we take turns cooking (or taste-testing) for each other, among other things.</p><p>Our benefits package for employees includes competitive base compensation along with stock options. &nbsp;The expected annual <span >salary</span> for this role is between $130,000 and $190,000, depending upon the job level, which will depend on your level of expertise, your experience, and your qualifications.&nbsp; We feel that you should be paid well for your contributions to our mission, and that you should stand to gain as we grow and succeed.&nbsp; We also provide fully-paid health insurance coverage for all of our employees.</p>",

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths among adults over 65. At the same time, fall prevention and emergency response systems for older adults are archaic and ineffective. This issue is exacerbated by the inefficient procedures that operators of these facilities are forced to use to provide care to their residents.&nbsp; Sage's integrated software aims to reinvent how we care for and respond to older adults in times of need.&nbsp; We aim to build a platform that gives caregivers the means to provide care for modern aging.</p><p>Sage is a small, tight team of ambitious, multi-disciplinary entrepreneurs.&nbsp; We are a software-enabled, mission-driven company, and are focused only on the problems that are central to achieving that mission.&nbsp; At Sage, we work hard and fast but also know that to build a truly important company, we need to treat our work as a marathon, and not a sprint.&nbsp; The journey matters.&nbsp; We know when to slow down, take breaks, and have fun.</p><b>About This Role</b><p>As a frontend engineer, you will be one of the main developers building the UI of the Sage platform, starting with the Sage Caregiver App.&nbsp; You will work directly with Sage's engineering and product leaders to design and implement features that will be used by front-line workers providing critical care, and you will have a direct impact on the direction the UI takes.&nbsp; In this role you will be responsible for ensuring that the features, look, and feel of our application meet the highest design and usability standards and that the application is a joy for our users to interact with.&nbsp; Experience with frontend web development and UI design is helpful, but most important is a strong software development foundation along with an unconstrained drive to learn and grow.</p><p>This role requires close collaboration with a small team of engineers, along with our CPO and other product managers.&nbsp; We believe in our developers building user empathy and having first-hand experience with the environments for which they are building.&nbsp; At times you will have direct exposure to users of the platform and opportunities to visit facilities to see the product in action.</p><p>Some examples of the work you could be doing on any given day include the following:</p><ul><li>Designing and implementing a feature that caregivers at a facility have requested&nbsp;</li><li>Implementing responsive UI layouts for desktop, iPad, and mobile</li><li>Optimizing UI performance by leveraging modern web tools</li><li>Partnering with our design team to think through the feasibility and implementation of a new design</li></ul><b>Requirements</b><p>These traits are essential to success in this role:</p><ul><li>At least 2 years of experience as a developer</li><li>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or related field or equivalent industry experience</li><li>Experience with a Javascript UI framework (ex. React, Angular, Vue)</li><li>Familiarity with interacting with REST APIs</li><li>Demonstrated ability to breakdown complex problems and explain them, at the correct level of detail, to both technical and non-technical audiences</li></ul><p>These are not essential, but are a plus:</p><ul><li>Experience with React and Redux</li><li>Experience with MaterialUI</li><li>Experience working with UI designers and product managers</li><li>Experience with Yarn and NPM</li><li>Experience designing REST APIs</li><li>Familiarity with UI design tools such as Figma</li></ul><b>Benefits</b><p>Our headquarters are located in New York City's lively Meatpacking district, and we run the office as you would a family household.&nbsp; While we take our mission seriously, we definitely do not take ourselves too seriously.&nbsp; We have grocery orders for snacks every Monday, drink orders whenever we run low, have team lunches out at local restaurants most days of the week, and get together for \"family dinners\" where we take turns cooking (or taste-testing) for each other, among other things.</p><p>Our benefits package for employees includes competitive base compensation along with stock options. &nbsp;The expected annual <span >salary</span> for this role is between $130,000 and $190,000, depending upon the job level, which will depend on your level of expertise, your experience, and your qualifications.&nbsp; We feel that you should be paid well for your contributions to our mission, and that you should stand to gain as we grow and succeed.&nbsp; We also provide fully-paid health insurance coverage for all of our employees.</p>",

Today the company runs one of the world's largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request.

Our mobile app development is on Flutter for that unified frontend experience. We chose Flutter because we didn&rsquo;t want to compromise on our ability to provide a true native experience on our mobile apps. This role requires experience in Android / iOS due to nuances in shipping.</div><div><br></div><div>As a mobile engineer at a growing fintech startup you are going to move the needle, but it will require a split personality: Your Dr. Jekyll leans towards correctness, tight release schedules, and writing reusable code that can scale as the app scales; your Hyde-side is one that focuses on moving quickly and shipping fast to get our product into our customers&rsquo; hands.</div><div><br></div><div>Our mission is to create fair, effective, and simple financial pathways to help 100M Americans reach their financial goals. Investors include Lightspeed, Coatue and GGV. Founders are serial entrepreneurs who co-founded and served as C-suite executives at 3 FinTech unicorns.</div><div><br></div><div>Requirements:</div><div>- B.A. / B.S. / M.S. or strong self-taught fundamentals in computer science</div><div>- Expertise in Android and/or iOS with experience shipping production-ready apps</div><div>- 4+ years of industry experience, with demonstrated breadth and depth of product impact</div><div>- Ability to analyze data and distill information for business purposes</div><div>- Effectiveness as demonstrated by problem-solving skills in areas outside your expertise</div><div>- Desire to form strong professional bonds with startup-forward coworkers</div><div><br></div><div>What we&rsquo;re like:</div><div>- Scrappy. We had a product goal and put out the MVP, collecting our first users with steady growth via paid channels in four months. We don&rsquo;t cut corners when we know we&rsquo;ll need them but we don&rsquo;t build things without that need. We don&rsquo;t like inefficiency but we dislike operationalizing one-off tasks even more.</div><div>- Risk-oriented. Everything has risk, but a mature team knows how to make these tradeoffs. That&rsquo;s why we built the MVP fast&ndash;&ndash;because time is your most valuable asset and is practically fungible with money in the startup world.</div><div>- Data-obsessed. We all look at data and pull it, and we believe that understanding the mechanics can yield valuable insights. Complex systems require elegant, not just simple solutions. You absolutely need to be interested in data if you want to leverage your knowledge of systems.</div><div>- Lucky. That&rsquo;s how we look at this journey so far. From our timing of fundraising, to the circumstances in which we came together, to the initial product traction we&rsquo;re getting, there&rsquo;s no other word to describe it. We are grateful you are reading this, and we know that if you&rsquo;re meant to be with us on this journey, then we will see you soon.</div><p><div><b>About Kikoff:</b></div><div>Kikoff is a personal finance platform designed to help millions of underserved Americans achieve financial wellness.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn&rsquo;t work together.<br/>So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions &ndash; to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we&rsquo;ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.<br/>Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes &ndash; large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time.

How does this work?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span >We believe buying enterprise software should be simple, pleasant, and fast instead of complex, painful, and slow (which is how it is today). Buyers now want instant access to presales (sales engineering) resources throughout the buying experience but they find it harder and harder to get what they need. Using Consensus, a sales engineering team builds a library of reusable interactive video demos that Sales sends out on-demand. Consensus automatically personalizes the experience and tracks engagement as the prospect shares the demo with other stakeholders in the buying group, bringing the entire buying group to live demos better educated and ready to talk specifics.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span >This not only reduces unqualified demos to near zero and can double the presales team&rsquo;s productivity, it also removes the \"demo lag time\" for prospects and shortens the sales cycle by as much as 68%.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><b >Our Values:&nbsp;</b></div><div><br></div><div><span >Our values are extremely important to us and we hope that they mean something to you too. We want everyone to bring their authentic selves to work every day. We hope you can help us continue to grow without having to be perfect, but willing to put your name on something knowing it is a &ldquo;version one&rdquo;.
